# PSCS (Path-based Semantic Code Search)

This repository contains source code necessary to reproduce the model in the paper:

PSCS: A Path-based Neural Model for SemanticCode Search

## Usage

### Requirements

- Python 3.6
- Pytorch 1.0.1
- NumPy

### Dataset

We use the [CodeSearchNet](https://github.com/github/CodeSearchNet) as our dataset.

Download the Java dataset following the instruction of [CodeSearchNet](https://github.com/github/CodeSearchNet), and move it to the directory `./data`.

The data exists in `./data` is an example for testing the pipeline.
